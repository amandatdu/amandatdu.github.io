          This was my first UX/UI internship ever! All I wanted to do was find problems I could help solve.
        </h3>
        At the beginning of our term, the team noticed an issue: we rarely seem to receive our customerâ€™s complaints or issues.
        <br /> <br />
        We were so eager to grow and learn, so we wanted to take matters into our own hands and sought out different ways to help LCBO. We noticed that a lot of our customers who have issues never actually reach us. Everything keeps getting lost in translation.
        <br /> <br />
        Due to NDA purposes, my case study can be found on the LCBOnext website.
